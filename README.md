# DimplesPay feature implementation

A new Flutter project.
_Version: 3.24.3_

## About

**State Management**
We've used [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for efficient state management.

**API Integration**
The app communicates with the [backend API](https://github.com/Asmitta-01/DimplesPay-api/) to fetch and send data. Ensure you have the correct API endpoints and authentication mechanisms in place.

**Note**: The api [baseUrl](https://github.com/Asmitta-01/Dimplespay-feature---Internship-Test/blob/bde7deecef0b35429c6fe162b1955d9ebc0e334e/lib/utils/api_service.dart#L10) value depends on your platform.

E.g.

- On real device it should be the ip address of your PC, assuming your device and Phone are on a same network.
- On an emulator you should put `10.0.2.2`

## Tasks

- Develop a small mobile application to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Consuming REST APIs for user authentication and wallet management.
- Implementing NFC card functionality.
- Adding a gift card purchasing and redeeming feature.

### Project Requirements

1. User Authentication
Implement a login system that allows users to log in using email and password.
Consume an API endpoint for user authentication. (Provide a mock API endpoint or instructions to set up a simple local API.)
Display a dashboard after login, showing the userâ€™s wallet balance and recent transactions.
2. Wallet Management
Fetch the user's wallet balance from an API and display it on the dashboard.
Provide functionality to top-up the wallet using a mock API endpoint.
3. NFC Card Features
Simulate NFC card functionality:
Activate a card: Provide an option to activate an NFC card using an API endpoint.
Top-up card balance: Allow the user to transfer funds from their wallet to the NFC card.
Deduct card balance: Implement a two-step process where the user enters an amount to deduct, confirms it, and enters a PIN to complete the transaction.
Add a feature to fetch and display NFC card details (e.g., card ID, balance).
4. Gift Card Features
Fetch a list of available gift cards from an API endpoint.
Allow the user to purchase a gift card using their wallet balance.
Provide a mock redemption feature where the user enters a code to redeem a gift card.
5. UI/UX
Use a clean and responsive design.
Display appropriate success and error messages for all actions.
6. API Handling
Demonstrate good API consumption practices (e.g., error handling, token-based authentication, proper HTTP methods).

### Deliverables

A working mobile app showcasing the requested features.
A brief documentation file explaining:
How to set up and run the app.
Any design or architectural choices made during development.
Areas for potential improvement or optimization.

### Evaluation Criteria

1. Code Quality: Clean, modular, and well-documented code.
2. API Integration: Ability to consume APIs effectively with proper error handling.
3. UI/UX Design: Simple and intuitive user interface.
4. Feature Completion: Implementation of all required features.
5. Problem-Solving: Handling edge cases and demonstrating a logical approach to challenges.
6. Mock API Endpoints (Provide or simulate locally)
You can provide mock endpoints using tools like Postman, JSON Server, or a simple Express.js/Flask API. Here are example endpoints:

### Technical Expectations

- Preferred Frameworks: Flutter
- State Management: Use any preferred state management solution.
- Version Control: Use Git for version tracking and share the repository link.
- Testing: Basic unit tests for at least one feature.
